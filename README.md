# Thought process
While doing the challenge, I will first mark down the business requirement like the 'Prefer heavier' or ' Always travelling in max speed' to ensure all of these requirements are fulfilled while developing. 

While the coding is running and the results returned is good, the first stage of development consider done. After that, the code will be reviewed again and clean any test code like logging and refractor some obvious performance issues code especially looping.

For the testing, TLD (Test Last Development) is implemented in this project instead of TDD (Test Driven Development) as I was stuck on how to translate the requirement into actual code, and learning takes time. Most of the time, implementing new calculation way will break my existing tests.
