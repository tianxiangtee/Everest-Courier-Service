Business Rule
====================
The following business rule must be followed:
1. Each Vehicle has a on limit (L) maximum weight (kg) that it can carry.

2. All Vehicles travel at the same speed (S km/hr) and in
the same route. It is assumed that all the destinations
can be covered in a single route.

3. Always travelling in max speed.

4. Post package delivery, vechicle will return back to the source station with the same speed and will be available for another shipment.

5. Shipment should contain max packages vehicle can carry in a trip without exceeding the max load provided

6. Prefer heavier packages when there are multiple shipments with the same no. of packages.

7. If the weights are also the same, preference should be given to the shipment which can be delivered first.

8. Roundoff estimated delivery time upto 2 digits.
(for example 3.456 becomes 3.45)

Sample Input Formats:
base_delivery_cost = 100
no_of_packges = 5

pkg_id1 = PKG1
pkg_weight1_in_kg = 50 
distance1_in_km = 30
offer_code1 = OFR001

pkg_id2 = PKG2
pkg_weight2_in_kg = 75
distance2_in_km = 125
offer_code2 = OFR008

pkg_id3 = PKG3
pkg_weight3_in_kg = 175
distance3_in_km = 100
offer_code3 = OFR003

pkg_id4 = PKG4
pkg_weight4_in_kg = 110
distance4_in_km = 60
offer_code2 = OFR002

pkg_id5 = PKG5
pkg_weight5_in_kg = 155
distance5_in_km = 95
offer_code5 = NA

no_of_vehicles = 2
max_speed = 70
max_carriable_weight = 200

Sample Output Format

PKG1 0 750 3.98
PKG2 0 1475 1.78
PKG3 0 2350 1.42
PKG4 105 1395 0.85
PKG5 0 2125 4.19
